## The Beths

This was the first proper project I took on early in my coding career. I noticed that a friend's band's website needed a redesign and decided it would be a good way to develop my web development skills.

### Key features:

- Backend built with [Sanity CMS](https://www.sanity.io/)
- Integrated Google Analytics using Google Tag Manager.
- Integrated a Songkick widget and Mailchimp sign up form.
- Added a GDPR banner that enables/disables analytics.

**Created using:** Next.js, SCSS, HTML and deployed using Heroku (soon to be Netlify).
