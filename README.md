## The Beths

This was the first proper project I took on early in my coding career. I noticed that a friend's band's website needed a redesign and decided it would be a good way to develop my web development skills.

### Task List:

- Integrate tinaCMS

### Key features:

- Designed and iterated on using Gravit.io.
- Mobile first and responsive.
- Integrated Google Analytics using Google Tag Manager.
- Integrated a Songkick widget and Mailchimp sign up form.
- Added a GDPR banner that enables/disables analytics.

**Created using:** NextJS, SCSS, HTML and deployed using Heroku.
