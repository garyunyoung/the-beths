***The Beths***

This was the first proper project I took on early in my coding career. I noticed that a friend's band's website needed a redesign and decided it would be a good way to develop my web development skills.

Key features: 
- Designed and iterated on using Gravit.io.
- Mobile first, responsive and accessible.Â 
- Integrated Google Analytics using Google Tag Manager.
- Integrated a Songkick widget. 
- Added a GDPR banner that enables/disables analytics.

Created using: NextJS, SCSS, HTML and deployed using Heroku.
